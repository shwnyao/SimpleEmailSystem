All required features have be implemented.

## Additional information:

1. When `#EXIT` is executed, the user would be logged out from the system. The connection remains there, and authentication is needed for further uses.
2. When `exit` is executed, the client will gracefully shutdown the connection and terminate the program.
3. Empty lines input are ignored at client level.
